/*
 * port_widescreen.h — single source of truth for the rendered viewport
 * width, shared by the ViruaPPU renderer and the engine-side on-screen /
 * culling tests in the port.
 *
 * Why this exists (see docs/widescreen-*.md):
 *   The GBA decomp hardcodes a 240-px playfield into its visibility math
 *   (CheckOnScreen's 0x16E, CheckRectOnScreen's 0xF0, per-enemy
 *   `scroll_x + 0x108` bounds, ...). When the PPU renders a wider frame
 *   but the engine still culls/parks against 240, entities the engine
 *   treats as "off-screen" (parked, or AI-gated past col 240) leak into
 *   the revealed area — the sprite-edge flicker that has blocked Phase 2.
 *
 *   The two reference GBA ports that actually ship widescreen both fix
 *   this the same way — by keying every cull/camera bound off one
 *   display-width constant instead of a literal 240:
 *     - SAT-R/sa2:      include/gba/defines.h (DISPLAY_WIDTH) +
 *                       include/game/shared/stage/camera.h (IS_OUT_OF_RANGE,
 *                       IS_OUT_OF_DISPLAY_RANGE, CAM_BOUND_X).
 *     - pret/pokeemerald: src/event_object_movement.c cull at
 *                       `x >= DISPLAY_WIDTH + 16`; src/sprite.c parks
 *                       off-screen sprites at `DISPLAY_WIDTH + 64`.
 *
 * PORT_VIEW_WIDTH is that constant for this port. It tracks
 * MODE1_GBA_WIDTH, which xmake injects from `--widescreen_width=N`
 * (default 240) so the renderer and the engine cull tests can never
 * disagree. At 240 every derived bound collapses to its GBA-original
 * value, so the default build is behaviourally identical to native.
 */

/* Mirror of the ViruaPPU compile-time width. Kept #ifndef-guarded so
 * this header is self-contained when included by a TU that does not pull
 * in <cpu/mode1.h>; xmake always defines MODE1_GBA_WIDTH for tmc_pc, so
 * in a real build the injected value wins and this fallback is inert. */
